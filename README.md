Hi, I am new on here , but I hope I can help some people. This is the first project I've worked on after my switch from programming to graphic design. My goal is to build a basic machine that can complete my tasks in a reasonable amount of time. It doesn 't have to be very powerful (but I want to push the envelope) and not be too complicated . The basic concept is this : When I type a snippet of text , it sends back an output of some kind .

(This blurb was generated with a GPT-2 prompt of "hi, I am". I have no experience with graphic design whatsoever.)
